Welcome to the world of gaming where most content will be on Roblox or any other games you suggest. Here is a guide for any beginners or wanderers if you want to know how anything works in this server.

# **Suggesting / Reporting**
- To suggest something on the server, use the forum post located in `➣ Community Forums` called `#suggestions`. You can create a post by adding a new post. Follow the channel rules there. You can also apply tags to your post to signify what it's for.
- To report any fatal problem on the server OR you have a problem dealing with someone, you can report these problems inside `#reporting-stuff`. Add a new post and apply a tag depending on what situation you're trying to report.

# **What is urgent?**
If a user is critically and negatively impacting our discord server in an unsafe way such as:
- Raiding the server
- Spamming continually
- Excessive/numerous amounts of harassments
- NSFW or swearing excessively (extends to VCs)
The moderators on the staff team will choose a harsher punishment for them based on their actions. However, it does not include interfering with staff members to make them think it is urgent.
This isn’t a thing where people joke around with major issues such as the list above, it’s also considered a major thing. *Make sure do not find loopholes within the rules*. There may be additional rules, or read each channel’s topics or the pinned messages.

# **What isn't urgent?**
If a user is negatively impacting our discord server in such a minor manner such as:
- Not using channels correctly/properly
- Tiny amounts of spam
- Asking them to stop even though they don’t stop
- Mini-modding (depending on their course of action)
The moderators will verbally warn the person at first; but sometimes they can be warned straight away if harsher enough for the punishment.
If you have any problems or concerns with this, don't hesitate to ask a Discord staff member.

# **Using Jr's Utilities**
If you seen this bot around, make sure to come say hi to it and interact with it! This is a privately owned custom bot that can only operate on this server and none other servers.
You can use `jr!help` to find a link to a list of commands.

# **Pinging others**
Pinging other people is allowed, *only* if they’re messaging in chat. This is a minor rule. If you ping others for literally no reason, you can be verbally warned or the person can tell you to stop. Continuing this will result in a punishment or a warning. 

Replying to other people also pings them unless you disabled pinging the message author. You can find out more [here](https://discord.com/channels/866550156198936616/866555862684401694/894691593867636787).

# **Need more help?**
If you require more help, assistance, questions/inquiries, you can see `#faq` or message a staff member through DMs.
